# Computer Organization Experiments

This repository contains the source code for the experiments of the Computer Organization course.

Source code is placed in `src` directory.

The `include` in each source file may cause warning in vivado, but it is not a big problem.

The source codes can be compiled and run in VSCode if the environment and extensions are set properly.
